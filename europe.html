                  Malta welcomes students from 90 different countries. Its
                  higher education system is one of the top rated.

                  International students feel more comfortable with English
                  being the official language of the country besides their own

                  Malta is one of the safest places and said to be the Mecca for
                  outdoor activities. Weather is compassionate for nearly 300
                  days of the year and hence the outdoor activities.

                  Malta was also under the British rule until a few years back
                  which explains its influence over the Maltese education
                  standards and operations.
